        <p>Git is a free and open source version control system. Git is very easy to learn and allows programmers to work in an effective and fluid manner</p>
        <p>For more information on Git check out the Git website <a href="https://git-scm.com/" alt="git website">here</a></p>

    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <section class="main-sections">
      <div>
        <h2 class="section-header">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The goal of this tutorial is to show the beginning programmer a quick introduction into a effortless Git workflow.</p>
        <p>There are so many Git commands that it can be overwhelming sometimes to learn Git at first, however I am to achieve the understanding of
        this version control system in a concise and simple manner. I recommend that you go through this tutorial multiple times just so you can get
        into the habit of this simple workflow.</p>
        <p>There is definately more to Git that you will want to learn, and I encourage you to always be learning. After this tutorial I will be posting other
        small sections on specific git scenarios that you will be using in a real-life job setting and if you're planning on working on an open-source project.</p>

    <!-- STEP ONE -->
    <section class="main-sections">
      <div>
        <h2 class="section-header">Step 1:</h2>
        <p>The first step into setting up a workflow is to log into your Github account to create a repository. If you need an account
        head over to <a href="https://github.com/" alt="github website">Github</a> and create an account.</p>
        <p>After you have logged in, or created your account, head into your profile and you will see a UI that looks like this:</p>
        <img src="css/img/git-1.jpg" alt="git tutorial image one" class="tut-img">
        <p>In the top right area you will see a green button that says <em>New</em>. Click that button and it will bring you to a page that allows you
        to name and create your repository.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <!-- STEP TWO -->
    <section class="main-sections">
      <div>
        <h2 class="section-header">Step 2:</h2>
        <p>Here you see a field to name your repository (repo for short) and a field that allows you to add a description for what your repo is going to be.</p>
        <img src="css/img/git-2.jpg" alt="git tutorial image two" class="tut-img">
        <p>After naming your repo and adding a description <strong>ignore</strong> intializing the repo with a README, license, or .gitignore file and click create repository. We can add the former files later
          when needed. </p>
      </div>

    <!-- STEP THREE -->
    <section class="main-sections">
      <div>
        <h2 class="section-header">Step 3:</h2>
        <p>The next step is to download Git Bash. Git Bash is going to be the command line program we use for all of our workflow commands. Essentially we will be connecting
        from Git Bash directly to our remote repo that we just created on Github.</p>
        <p>You can head over to the <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git website</a> and download the client for your operating system.</p>
        <p>Now that you have Git downloaded open it up and you will see a command line window such as this:</p>
        <img src="css/img/git-clear.png" alt="git tutorial image three" class="tut-img">
        <p>Now we want to create a folder on your Desktop for your project so we can link it up to our remote repo. After you create your folder use Git to change to
        change to that folder's directory shown here:</p>
        <img src="css/img/git-3.png" alt="git tutorial image four" class="tut-img">
        <p>We use the command <em>cd</em> (short for change directory) to change to our created folder. If your folder name has spaces, such as mine, then use quotes around
        it when using the <em>cd</em> command else no quotes are required.
